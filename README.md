# LangDiversity_USA
This is my final project for DATA303. It analyzes language diversity in the United States.

In order to run, make sure you type 'geo_map.py' into your powershell when you run it. For some reason the .py is included in the name.

A lot of my time was used trying to figure out dash, hence why it isn't very decorated. I decided to just make it useful and readable, not grand and flashy. If I had more time, I would like to learn more about the CSS attributes and make it look prettier.
